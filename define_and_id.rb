# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# YOU DO the rest:

#Checks to see if the string "Hello" is included in the string "Hello World"
"Hello World".include?("Hello")

#Checks to see if the string "Hello World" ends with the string "Hello"
"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")

#Checks to see if the string "Hello World" ends with the string "rld"
"Hello World".end_with?("rld")

#Checks to see if the int 12 is even.
12.even?

#Rounds the int 18 to the next whole number
18.next
